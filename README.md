# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 3RD WEEK PROJECT
Welcome to my 3rd week project for the 'Become a Software Developer' RR's course. You'll find here an HTML structure and CSS styles for a News Page Layout.

## Description
The objective of the 3rd week project was to create a responsive layout for a News Webpage, following the [W3School Layout Pattern](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp)

In this repo, you'll find:
* An HTML index file with the structure of the layout.
* A 'styles' folder with 2 files: 'reset.css' that normalizes all the default styles of the page, and the 'index.css' that contains all the styles of the layout.
* An 'images' folder that contains all of the images used in the page.

The layout was designed using the concept of Mobile First. It also uses flexbox for responsivity, and it has a media query breakpoint for differentiate the mobile from the desktop version.

### Clarifications
* If you had any ad-blocker extension installed in your browser, you won't be able to see the Ads. You'll need to stop it to see them.

## Getting Started
